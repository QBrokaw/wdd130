      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[I would like to Build a Fan site dedicated to The Fictional Character "The Saint" by Leslie Charteris, He wrote 50+ books with this character, they made 10 years' worth of tv shows and multiple movies from this character. These were mostly made in the 1950-1970 and I feel that they are being lost and forgotten. ]</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>[The world at large, any one who loves old school, tough guy, spy movies will love this sight dedicated to the Character "The Saint!"]</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Main Site
        This site will be dedicated to the fictional character “Simon Templar” aka “The Saint.”
        Simon Templar is a good man that helps catch thieves, murders, criminals, and anyone doing bad things. The main page will be an overview of who is, what his main story line is about and a history of the books, tv shows, movies and music. It will be about Leslie Charteris the author of the original books. These books were published between 1928 and 1963. I would also like to embed YouTube clips.  One big part of The Saint is the stick figure that was on the cover of the books and carried into the tv shows and the movies, I would like to include multiple images on the main page of The Saint stick figure. 
        One other idea I have is to either have the tv theme song play when you first come to the site or embed a YouTube clip so that you can listen to it. There has also been a few revisions of the theme song and I would like to find a place to show them off too. Orbital has a great version.

      </ul>
      <h3>The Saint Books</h3>
      <p>
        The second page I would like to be dedicated to his books. They have amazing art work on the covers and I know it would be a lot of work but I would like to try and list them all with images of the cover. This one might be too much to do for this class there are a lot of books, but I want to try including as many as I possibly can. There were 56 books written. I would also like to include a picture of the author Leslie Charteris.

      </ul>
      <h3>The Saint Tv Shows and Movies</h3>
      <p>
        The third page I would like to dedicate to the tv series and the actors that played The Saint. Maybe even a list of all the episodes and seasons. I would also like to embed a clip of the tv series so that you can click on it and see it without leaving the page. This one might also be a little more than I have time for, there are 118 episodes. I might have to link to the Wikipedia page for them.
I would also like to show case the Movies made of The Saint and the actors that played Simon Templar. On this page I would also like to embed a clip of the 1997 movie. (This was where I was introduced to the character.) There was also a lapel pin of the stick figure in this movie, I want to include a picture of the pin on this page. (I always wanted one, so if I can’t have the pin, posting a picture of it for all to see will be just as good. 
Conclusion
My hope with this site is to give a modern feel to Simon Templar, most of the sites out there are old school html with very little CSS. I would like to add some of the modern techniques
