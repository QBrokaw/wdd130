    Hey everyone, My name is Quincy, My friends call me Red and my Family calls me Q.

    <p>    
    I work in the oil fields of utah, I am work in a OT/Scada/comms dept. I am 4 classes away from my
    Bacholers in Applied Technology. Right now I am not sure if I want to stay in OT or switch to IT,
    But I sure am glad to have the option. Right now I have the programming cert, the computer support cert, and I will get my system admin cert along with my Bacholers, and right now there is a werid part of me that wants to keep going after for the web development cert. In my programming cert, I found I like Javascript/HTML more than python. I really hope to get out of this class a deeper knowledge of web development and see if I want to chase that last cert.

    My Favorite scripture is: Moroni 10:5  And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may aknow the truth of all things.
    I love the fact that the Holy Ghost is the greatest teacher, and through him we can learn the gospel or anything that is worthy to learn.
